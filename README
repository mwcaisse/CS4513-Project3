How to Make:
	
	make all 
		to build all executables, nutella and player
	
	make nutella 
		to make the nutella streamer
	
	make player 
		to make the simple test standalone player
		
How to run:

	./nutella ipaddr movies_dir
		where ipaddr is the IP address of the local computer to send to clients
			and movies_dir is the path to the directory containing the movies
	
		example:
			./nutella 192.168.1.160 ./movies/
			
When trying to stream movies, the server expects the full name of the movie file
	as it appears in the movie directory
	
	for example to play tiger.txt in the ./movies/ directory,
		one must enter the move name as "tiger.txt"
